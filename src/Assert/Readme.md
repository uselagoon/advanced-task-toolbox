# Assertions

This folder contains all the basic assertions required for Advanced Tasks.

Essentially an assertion will simply assert whether a particular fact about an environment/project is either true or false.
We use assertions as guards against, for example, running tasks in the wrong environment,
or checking that the steps we've run have been properly effected.
